Enketo Express
==============

_The modern [Enketo Smart Paper](https://enketo.org) web application._

-------

This is a fork of [enketo/enketo-express](https://github.com/enketo/enketo-express) that has the following additions:

1. An [account manager](https://swaggerhub.com/api/Enketo/enketo-express-oc-account-manager) to use multiple accounts with a single Enketo installation.
2. A [fieldsubmission](./doc/fieldsubmission.md) webform view that uses [OpenClinica's Fieldsubmission API](https://swaggerhub.com/api/martijnr/openclinica-fieldsubmission).
3. An OpenClinica theme: [theme-oc](https://github.com/OpenClinica/enketo-express-oc/tree/master/app/views/styles/theme-oc).
4. [Advanced comment widgets](./doc/advanced-comment-widgets.md): [discrepancy note widget](./doc/advanced-comment-widgets.md#discrepancy-notes-widget)

-------


**To get started visit our [technical documentation](https://enketo.github.io/enketo-express).**

------

OpenClinica users, in addition to the configuration documentation linked above, may want to take special note of these recommended settings:

0. Set a secret value for `"account manager api key"`.
1. The `"linked form and data server"` should have a non-empty value for `"server url"` to avoid bypassing the Account Manager API. E.g. leave the default value.
2. Set `"disable save as draft": true`
3. Set `"repeat ordinals": true`. [This feature](./doc/ordinals.md) is required for the fieldsubmission webform views.
4. Set `"query parameter to pass to submission": "ecid"`
5. Set `"validate continuously": true`
6. Set `"validate page": false` (though some applications may wish to use `true`)
7. Set `"default theme": "oc"`
8. Set `"text field character limit": 3999`


OpenClinica users, to build special Internet Explorer 11 javascript bundles, do after the regular build (ie. `npm install`):

0. `grunt build-ie11`
